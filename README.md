# Huebris

An attempt at generating palettes. These will eventually be used for recoloring my background and theming apps, but for now I just want palettes.

*This work is heavily inspired by both [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) and [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works).*
